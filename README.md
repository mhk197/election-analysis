# Election Audit

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to audit the results of a congressional election, at the request of the election commission. I analyzed the votes cast during the election in relation to both candidates and voting counties using a Python script. First, I determined the number of votes for each candidate, the proportion of total votes that each candidate received, and the winning candidate. Second, I calculated the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county relative to the total vote count, and the county with the highest voter turnout.
